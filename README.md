# Find-the-File

This is a code which finds out the file which you are seaching for in your computer harddrive
and returns back the location of that file if a file with that name exists.

Problem with this code is that it takes a lot of time on a computer which has more the number 
of files, hence this code has yet to be improved if you are to use it on massive storage 
system as it checks files by storage.

Changes can be made easily based on tentative systems you are to use this code on. If the
storage system data is small, this is a better approach.
